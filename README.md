This Streamlit-based app provides a visual and interactive solution for optimizing the cutting of rectangular pieces from available sheet materials. It uses the rectpack library to compute efficient layouts that minimize wastage. Features include:

	•	Input forms for multiple sheet sizes and piece dimensions
	•	Automatic packing optimization (no rotation)
	•	Visual representation of each sheet and its cut layout using Matplotlib
	•	Summary tables for piece placement and sheet usage
	•	Wastage percentage calculation per sheet

Ideal for material cost optimization in manufacturing, carpentry, and fabrication industries.
